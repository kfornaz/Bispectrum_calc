# Bispectrum_calc
Algorithm for bispectrum developed following this paper--> https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.08107

Here you find some scripts for calculate and analise bispectrum.

Bell is calculated from a map (healpix one). For didatical reasons, we separete the script in "foregrounds" and "thermal noise", but, in fact, the only diference on both codes is the input- which could be a therma_noise map or foreground - or anyone.
